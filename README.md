Working with the Shipy library on mathematical calculations for Data Science. The notebook presents methods for calculating first- and second-order derivatives of a function of one or more variables, graphical sampling of the data obtained, basic operations with matrices, working with various types of distributions of probability theory and statistics. A recommendation model based on the cosine criterion of a vector set is presented.
